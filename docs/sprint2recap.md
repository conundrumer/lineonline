Sprint 2 Recap:
[This file is now outdated as for our goals for the remainder of the application. See Sprint 3 Goals for more details.]


Completed:
-- Refactored from single index.js file to node project organization like madhums' works
    -- Learned how to connect express with models, use routes, authentication
-- Wrote a database manager
-- Wrote testing scripts
-- Learned mocha tests for unit testing
    -- since we don't yet have front-end for post / delete requests connected to backend
        we use this to test post, delete
-- Reactified our front end; it used to use Jade


Started:
-- Wrote half of the Rest API for a single page application
    -- Major component
-- Subscriptions: need testing and connecting to the front end
-- Tracks: need testing and connecting to the front end


Pushed to Next Sprint:
-- Collaboration elements:
    -- Track implemented for LineRider (currently has placeholder info)
    -- Invites for collaboration
    -- Conversations / Messages (sidepanel chatbox during collaboration)
    -- Web Sockets for realtime collaboration


Pushed to Product Backlog:
-- Gallery
-- Collections
    -- Both of these would only become significant after we have set up the LineRider-based tracks functionality. Because we encountered more overhead in learning how to use at least 14 new technologies so far, we have decided to reduce the scope of our project.


Issues Encountered:
-- Massive overhead of all the new technologies
-- Single-page application + Rest API
-- Snigdha and Jing out of town 2/days per week for on site interviews
