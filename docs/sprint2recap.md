###Sprint 2 Recap:
    [See Spring 3 Goals for more updated details about our goals for the remainder of the application.]

####Completed:
* Refactored from single index.js file to node project organization like madhums' works
    * Learned how to connect express with models, use routes, authentication
* Wrote a database manager
* Wrote testing scripts
* Learned mocha tests for unit testing
    * Since we don't yet have all the front-end connected to backend yet, we use this to test certain endpoints
* Rebuilt the front-end views as reusable components with React


####Started:
* Wrote half of the Rest API for a single page application
    * Major component
* Subscriptions: need testing and connecting to the front-end
* Tracks: need testing and connecting to the front-end
* Divided flow of app into actions / datastore / views
    * Used SuperAgent to make requests to auth endpoints for login/logout/register


####Pushed to Next Sprint:
* Collaboration elements:
    * Track implemented for LineRider (currently has placeholder info)
    * Invites for collaboration
    * Conversations / Messages (sidepanel chatbox during collaboration)
    * Web Sockets for realtime collaboration


####Pushed to Product Backlog:
* Gallery
* Collections
    * Both of these would only become significant after we have set up the LineRider-based tracks functionality. Because we encountered more overhead in learning how to use at least 14 new technologies so far, we have decided to reduce the scope of our project.


####Issues Encountered:
* Massive overhead of all the new technologies
* Single-page application + Rest API
* Snigdha and Jing out of town 2/days per week for on site interviews
