###Sprint 3 Goals:

We are making a pretty substantial pivot for LineOnLine per Salem and Shannon's advice. We will no longer be making it a priority to implement the real-time collaborative features for LineRider, shifting our focus instead to building a solid web application contingent upon shareable LineRider tracks. We will do the following:

####Our steps:
1. Create the simple LineRider application for a single user such that it could be saved and shared across the website
2. Complete and polish the grumblr aspects of the web application
3. Add collaborative LineRider editing, though not necessarily in real-time

####This entails the following:
1. Build a simple line drawing editor
2. Finish the Rest API / fully connecting front-end & backend
3. Finish Subscriptions, Favorites
4. Instead of Conversation, create a Feed for responses to a track
5. Gallery
6. Collections
