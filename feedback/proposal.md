### Arthur
Very cool project idea. Given the team's frontend experience, it seems like it will be a manageable project in terms of scope. I would like to give some input in terms of the technologies. HTML5 canvas is definitely a necessity here, but it is generally a pain to deal with just on its own. Consider using a drawing library that uses the HTML5 canvas - KineticJS is one of many examples. I'm curious about where you are planning to use React.js. I don't know how useful it would be for the LineRider part itself. I've done a lot of work with node.js and React so feel free to come chat with me!

### Salem
This sounds like a pretty cool project. I love Line Rider, and I know it's not a super trivial thing to work on. Collaboration may be interesting; consider using something like Firebase or (cooler imho) socket.io to make real-time stuff easier and snappier. I'd also like to see what sort of collaboration stuff you have fleshed out. Do you want just maps? Do you want people to share maps? Racing? You should probably elaborate a bit on that. I personally know a fair bit of node and am certainly down to provide guidance if needed. 

### Shannon
This sounds like a fine idea to me. The only concern I have is that you should make sure that the division of work is such that each member gets to implement and have experience with features we have learned or seen in class. It wouldn't be ideal if only one person developed the game and thus does not do any of the web application development.
