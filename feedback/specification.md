Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (10/10)
  * Looks good to me! (We talked a bit about this project in person, too). 

### Data Models (10/10)
  * This looks pretty detailed, although it would probably not be a bad idea to discuss the structure of the scene blob you're storing in the db. 

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (10/10)
  * I had to squint, but it looked good to me. It probably wouldn't hurt to use a bit more paper next time, if only because it will afford you more room for detail. 

### Sprint 1 Planning (10/10)
  * Try to stay away from things like "All" as you all likely won't be working on that one feature. If you are, it may be the case that your task is too general. Additionally (I thiiink I sent an email about this to you guys), you should try to have a deliverable at the end of each sprint that could hypothetically stand on its own. In other words, try not to group tasks by functionality, but by what would make for a good iteration on the product.
