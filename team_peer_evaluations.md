===========

We did not really set hard deadlines for each other, but we prioritized, regularly re-prioritized, and had loosely defined expectations as we went along regarding which features each person would be working on at that time. This was partially due to the fact that Snigdha and Jing were flying out a lot in the beginning of the project. However, it became more regular as time went by.

Communication was relatively good; we were using Trello during the first two sprints to keep in mind which tasks we were working on or putting on the backlog for the next sprint. Trello was also incredibly helpful for sharing information regarding the (many many many) technologies we were learning. We used FB chat basically every day for immediate issues and met frequently at Morewood / Resnik / Fairfax / Music Technology Cluster. We were pretty loose about those meeting times and would meet as needed, and we would Skype if we were physically apart. We used pull requests to document and handle every feature.

There were a few major project problems we ran into. Bookshelf did not have a nice manager like Django, so David implemented his own. It would have been nice to have more 'documentation' (i.e. StackOverflow) and perhaps better, examples, on Bookshelf, for example. There were some technologies we used that were perhaps "too new," e.g. React Router updating with breaking changes halfway through. The front-end was very messy, and organizing it was a monumental task because of its complexity. Also, Snigdha didn't have very much experience with...any of these technologies, and major concepts like asynchronous programming, or configuration things, or the fact that you can keep working even if Postgres is telling you it is having errors, so she would sometimes get stuck for many many tearful lonely hours, especially regarding many-to-many relations, or just relations in general a la Bookshelf. Halfway through the project, at one point, Snigdha and Jing lost direction and diverged in implementing features without regards to the opposite end, so there was a major effort to define the API, where Test Driven Development followed. Usually if people had problems though they would communicate it to David whose magical full stack powers helped bridge the divide.

Jing
----
    * Visual & UI / UX design
    * Styling (Compass/Sass) (no bootstrap!)
    * Learned and used React & React Router
    * Created all front-end components / user interactions
    * Used flux architecture (actions -> stores -> components -> actions)
    * Connected back end & front-end via Rest API
    * Heroku deployment

    * Contributed to unit tests

Snigdha
----
    * Learned node, Javascript, express, bookshelf, promises / async -- which she will be using in Nike!
    * Learned the fact that using libraries doesn't mean you have to learn all of it - just the pieces you need
    * Learned how a project is managed -- in this case via trello
    * Learned about test-driven-development (mocha testing), which she will be using in Nike!
    * Learned about npm install and package.json
    * Learned how to organize the backend into models, controllers, config, test, util
    * Finally became comfortable with developing using git, merging, branching, pull requests
    * And then used all of the above ^
    * Struggled with many-to-many relations
    * Didn't realize that Postgres having errors doesn't mean you can't keep working
    * Initiated meetings to keep group on task during first sprint
    * Implemented password encryption
